        "Note that most of the time is spent on the lu factorization step, not on the solving step (the differences between the times of the last two steps is minimal).  So if you have a relatively large matrix that you need to solve many times, you should take the extra work to explicitly perform the LU factorization and save it. Then each of your solving steps will be relatively quick.  But if your matrix is small, or you only need to solve it once, the ```solve``` function  is fine to use. "
