It is used to describe the behavior of systems that are made of a large number of ferromagnetic atoms, such as iron (although it has many applications beyond ferromagnets and even physics).  There are two  basic assumption of the model:\n",

If the observable is denoted by $A$, we express that as:\n",

Note that the denominator is typically denoted by the variable $Z$ (this is the \"partition function\" of the system) so its advisable to use that variable name in your program.
