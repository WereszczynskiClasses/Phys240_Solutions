But you'll find this is fairly limited, and often you'll want to store many things in one variable.  To do this, python has several major structures. The one that will be the most useful for us are arrays, and we'll focus on them, although it's worth being familiar with the list as a first step."

If we have the values of the terms in the sum stored in a list or array then we can calculate the sum using the built-in function sum described above.
